## Hi there, I'm ItzSlicedcorn 👋

### I'm a ✨ Computer Science student ✨, however I haven't done much on here or in terms of projects in general.

## Kinds of Classes I'm in currently (as of 9-4-25):

- A class going over Operating Systems and how they're used and how they work. 🖥️
- Computer Science II. 💻
- Calculus 1. 🧮
- Studying of western classical music. 🎻

## Things I'm interested in outside of coding:

- Listening to music and playing instruments. 🎵
- Guitar Hero, Rock Band and their related games, along with arcade rhythm games such as DDR. 🎸
- Old technology (mainly from the early 90s - early 2000s) 📁
- Collecting physical media, like albums on vinyl and cd and video games. 💿

# More info will be on the way soon™.
